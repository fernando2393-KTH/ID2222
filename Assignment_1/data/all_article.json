{"0": "Spanish experts and authorities remain divided on home lockdown  The Asturias region believes the measure will ease the pressure on hospitals, but epidemiologists and the Health Ministry argue it is better to wait and assess the impact of the current coronavirus restrictions While Spain’s hospitals are able to cope with a rise in coronavirus patients, the restrictions aimed at slowing the pandemic have room to fail. But once hospitals reach breaking point, there is only one option that has proven to be completely effective: home lockdown. Many European countries have already introduced this measure, even though their intensive care units (ICUs) have not yet reached their limit. In Spain, another confinement is under consideration but neither health authorities nor experts can agree on whether it is needed. The debate was sparked last Sunday by the North African exclave city Melilla, which has the highest 14-day cumulative number of coronavirus cases per 100,000 inhabitants of all Spain’s territories: 1,356. In a bid to control the spread of the virus, the head of Melilla, Eduardo de Castro, asked the central government to authorize home confinement in the exclave city and consider a return to remote learning. This was followed by a similar call on Monday from the premier of Asturias, Adrián Barbón, who asked the government to widen the state of alarm to enable it to introduce shelter-in-place measures for 15 days. On October 25, Spain’s Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez declared a state of alarm to grant central and regional authorities the power to introduce restrictions on mobility. But the emergency state, which has been approved by parliament for six months, stops short of letting regions impose unilateral home confinements. Spain had a strict home confinement during the first wave of the coronavirus, between mid-March and mid-June. But Health Minister Salvador Illa rejected the request of the Asturian regional government. When asked about the possibility of home confinement on Monday, Illa replied: “We are neither working on it nor expecting it. We think the wide range of measures available to regional authorities is enough.” The Health Ministry has organized a videoconference with the Asturian health authorities for Tuesday to discuss alternative measures to home confinement. Asturias will also suspend all non-essential business activity from Wednesday. Other regions are also considering home confinement. In an interview with the Cadena SER radio network, the health chief of Castilla y León, Verónica Casado, said: “Confinement is going to happen because we need it to slow the virus, although work, education and other aspects that we did not have in March [during the total lockdown] will be allowed. But we will have to limit non-essential activity and be at home, we are going to have to do it.” The leader of Castilla-La Mancha, Emiliano García Page, said the region had not ruled out “stricter models and confinements,” while the deputy premier of Andalusia, Juan Marín, admitted Spain was “heading in the direction” of France – which has ordered a total lockdown – and that home confinement measures “could arrive in the next few days.” Basque premier Iñigo Urkullu has called a domestic lockdown the “final option,” but has not ruled it out, nor has the regional government of La Rioja. The incidence rate of the virus in these regions is above the Spanish average, but this is not the case for Asturias, which has better epidemiological data than most regions. Despite this, regional authorities believe tougher measures are needed to curb the rising number of coronavirus cases and ease the pressure on hospitals. In a few weeks, the 14-day cumulative number of cases per 100,000 inhabitants in Asturias has gone from 200 to nearly 400. The city of Gijón, where the Cabueñes hospital is already at breaking point, is the main concern, reports Juan Navarro. The region insists that if the spread of the pandemic is not slowed as soon as possible, the health system will reach breaking point. Asturias’s director of public health, Rafael Cofiño, explains that the region is asking for measures similar to those under Phase 1 of the national deescalation plan, with time slots allocated for outdoor activity. Divisions between health experts Health experts are also divided on whether home confinement is necessary based on the current data. None of the professionals who spoke to EL PAÍS supported a return to the total lockdown declared in March, when Spaniards were not allowed to go outside unless for essential business. If home confinement were to be introduced, they believe that going outside for a walk would still be allowed and schools would remain open if possible. Daniel López Acuña, a former official at the World Health Organization (WHO), believes home confinement is inevitable. “The state health authority and the Inter-Territorial Council [which brings together the regions’ health chiefs] must urgently agree to measures to order home confinement for 15 days to slow the pandemic and prevent hospitals from reaching breaking point. A new state of alarm that makes this possible needs to be declared.” José Martínez Olmos, the former general secretary of the Health Ministry and a professor at the Andalusian School of Public Health, agrees: “Home confinement is unavoidable and desirable in some territories where there is an objective risk of hospitals reaching breaking point. There’s no reason why it has to be for all of Spain, although given how things are, we should not rule anything out. Saving lives is the priority.” But other epidemiologists are less sure. Andrea Burón, the spokesperson of the Spanish Public Health Association (Sespas), believes it is better to wait to see if the coronavirus restrictions introduced last week, such as the nighttime curfew and perimetral lockdowns, have an effect on transmission rates. It would take at least another week for this to be reflected in the data. “Home confinement is very restrictive with respect to people’s freedoms. I think it is appropriate to give the measures already applied a little more time and assess whether they are working,” she says. Fernando Rodríguez-Artalejo, a professor of public health at Madrid’s Autonomous University, supports this view. “We don’t know exactly where contagions are happening, nor if the measures that are being taken are being followed. I understand the temptation of wanting to be more restrictive when the hospital curve is rising and we see that other countries are introducing more restrictions, and we don’t want to be left behind. But this is not coming from a very rational basis,” he says, warning that until it is known where the disease is spreading, measures will be applied “blindly.” An intermediate option is to close down the hostelry sector, a measure that has already been introduced in Catalonia. Between the closure of bars and restaurants, perimetral lockdowns and the curfew, this region has created a situation very similar to home confinement. Antoni Trilla, professor of preventive medicine at Barcelona University, believes that the positive impact of these measures will soon be reflected in the region’s data. He explains: “Confinement is something that will have to be assessed in each territory according to the state of their ICUs. Hopefully, we won’t reach that point, but it can’t be ruled out. If this measure is taken, what authorities must do is explain the reason why and with what data it is based on.” English version by Melissa Kitson. ", "1": "Spain sets new weekend record for coronavirus cases, fatalities in the second wave Monday’s Health Ministry report included 55,019 new infections and added 379 victims to the overall death toll The best thing that can be said about the spread of the coronavirus in Spain is that it is growing at a constant speed. Last Monday, the rise in the number of new cases – a figure that covers the weekend, given that no data is released on Saturdays and Sundays – was 12.7%. Yesterday, it came it at 12.9%. The number of new cases reported on Monday by the Health Ministry was 55,019, and 379 victims were added to the death toll – both new records for this second wave of the virus. The total number of official infections in Spain now stands at 1,240,697, and the death toll is 36,257. Excess deaths for the year, however, could be as high as 60,000, given that many people with the coronavirus passed away during the first wave without being tested. The numbers reported on Monday arrived at a time when regions such as Asturias have called for restrictions to be toughened yet further, going so far as a domestic lockdown similar to that introduced across the country at the start of the pandemic – a decision that Castilla y León, Andalusia and the Basque Country are not ruling out should the situation not start to improve. The health minister, Salvador Illa, and the defense minister, Margarita Robles, both warned on Monday that the new state of alarm – implemented by the government last weekend to give the regions the legal framework they need to introduce coronavirus measures that limit mobility – does not allow for home confinement. Illa stated that he trusted that the “drastic measures” being taken by the regions would mean that such a decision will not be necessary, despite the fact that this is what Germany, Italy, Belgium, France, Portugal and the United Kingdom are all doing. The 14-day cumulative number of coronavirus cases per 100,000 inhabitants continues to rise, according to Monday’s report. It is currently at 521.07, compared to 485.28 on Friday. In one week, this parameter has risen 44%. In the Valencia region, however, the figure is falling, dropping from 231.47 to 225.79 since Friday. The data point has also improved in Madrid, dropping to 403.58, and the Canary Islands (76.44). The parameters that indicate the situation of the country’s healthcare system – the number of Covid patients, and what proportion of these are in intensive care units (ICUs) – also continue to rise. The proportion of beds occupied by these patients is now 15.51%, compared to 14.17% on Friday. In Aragón, Castilla-La Mancha and Castilla y León, as well as the North African cities of Ceuta and Melilla, the figure is above 20%. As for ICUs, occupation is now 28%, up two points from Friday. There are currently 19,170 Covid patients in Spanish hospitals, and 2,650 people in intensive care. These figures for hospital patients have not stopped rising. For example, in the previous 24 hours, according to Monday’s report, 800 more people were admitted to ICUs than were discharged. On Friday this difference was 475. Aragón, Catalonia, La Rioja and Ceuta and Melilla have more than 40% of their ICU beds dedicated to Covid patients, and that is taking into account that many hospitals are preparing beds in other spaces such as surgeries and rehabilitation spaces. In theory, the effect of the new measures that were taken by the regions ahead of the state of alarm should be seen this week in the figures, given that the time between a new coronavirus infection and its detection in the health system is, on average, between seven and 10 days. The rise in hospitalizations, for example, a key data point in terms of whether more restrictions are needed, has slowed somewhat, falling from 22.66% two weeks ago to 19.75% last week. This parameter is rising above that of new cases, because between the diagnosis and a worsening of the patient’s condition there is on average another week-and-a-half. Asturias, the region that is requesting home confinement, has seen its cases rise at a stable 22% in the last two weeks, giving a cumulative figure of 50% in 15 days. It is not the worst, however. Andalusia, Ceuta and Melilla have all seen greater rises. But this increase, which is double the average for all of Spain in the same period, has prompted its regional government to call for a tougher lockdown. The region is one of those that has best weathered the second wave of the coronavirus. Its 14-day cumulative number of coronavirus cases per 100,000 inhabitants is at 416.41, which is below the average of 521.07. But while it was fourth from the bottom of the list, it is now seventh out of Spain’s 17 regions. What’s more, hospital bed occupation has risen 109.51% in two weeks, the second-highest percentage in the system, only exceeded by Cantabria. Its intensive care units have also seen huge pressure in 15 days. The number of ICU beds occupied by Covid patients has grown 137% in two weeks, the biggest rise in Spain. English version by Simon Hunter.", "2": "Spanish government refuses a region’s request for home confinement Asturias, in northern Spain, will instead close all non-essential businesses from Wednesday in a bid to contain the spread of the coronavirus The premier of the Spanish region of Asturias, Adrián Barbón, announced on Monday that he had asked the central government to authorize a 15-day home confinement in the northern region in a bid to contain the spread of the coronavirus – a request that had also been made by the exclave city of Melilla in North Africa a day earlier. But the Spanish government informed authorities in Asturias that home confinement is not possible at this time and that they must first wait to see if the current coronavirus restrictions lower transmission rates. “When you take measures, it takes 10 to 15 days to see results,\" said Health Minister Salvador Illa. “Therefore we need a bit of moderation and know how to wait the necessary time to see the effects of very drastic measures, rather than fall into some kind of competition to see who takes the toughest measure.”  Barbón, of the Socialist Party (PSOE), made the announcement after meeting with the region’s Covid-19 crisis committee to discuss the situation in Asturias, which has recorded more than 3,000 new coronavirus cases in the eight last days of October. The cumulative number of coronavirus cases per 100,000 inhabitants in the region has risen to 400 and the region’s hospital and intensive care units (ICUs) are under record-high pressure. The region is now at Level 4 on the central government’s coronavirus alert system, indicating extreme risk. On October 25, Spain’s Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez declared a state of alarm to grant central and regional authorities the power to introduce restrictions on mobility. But the emergency state, which has been congressionally approved for six months, stops short of letting regions impose unilateral home confinements. Instead, it is up to central authorities to approve the measure, which has already been introduced in the United Kingdom and France. Spain had a strict home confinement during the first wave of the coronavirus, between mid-March and mid-June. Health Minister Illa has said on numerous occasions that a new home confinement will not be necessary. Asked about the measure on Monday, just before Barbón’s announcement, Illa said: “We are not expecting it or working on it right now.” Speaking at an online conference organized by the communication agency Intermedia, Illa said that regional governments are already able to introduce a “wide range of measures” via the state of alarm. Thanks to this legal framework, regions can set limits on social gatherings and introduce perimetral lockdowns – restrictions that Illa argued were “enough” to control the spread of the pandemic. The health minister did, however, acknowledge that it is a “very complex and worrying moment” for Spain. Non-essential activity suspended Asturias premier Barbón also announced that the government will suspend “all non-essential economic activity” from Wednesday, and bring forward the nighttime curfew – currently between 11pm and 6am – to 10pm. These measures, which are aimed at reducing mobility and social interaction, will be in place for 15 days, after which time they may be extended. “There is no other way,” said Barbón at the news conference to announce the restrictions on Monday. Regional health chief Pablo Fernández explained that all establishments that sell food and basic goods, as well as pharmacies, hairdressers and restaurants that provide home delivery and takeaway will be allowed to remain open. Under the new rules, which will be published on Tuesday in the region’s Official Gazette, all shopping centers will be closed, in-person classes at universities will be reduced to the bare minimum, public events and recreational activities will be suspended and all business meetings canceled. These measures do not need to be authorized by the central government and will come into effect on Wednesday. Barbón said that Asturias is facing a “critical moment of the second wave of the pandemic” and admitted that the scale of the problem has exceeded the regional government’s expectations. The premier said the new restrictions are needed to avoid a complete collapse of the healthcare system, which has come under mounting pressure due to the rising number of coronavirus patients. Barbón said that he would talk to the sectors set to be hardest hit by the measures to discuss ways to alleviate their economic impact. The head of public health, Rafael Cofiño, reiterated the importance of creating “social bubbles” to control social contact and called on residents to limit socializing as much as possible. The area of greatest concern in Asturias is Gijón, while Oviedo and Avilés have a more stable incidence rate of the virus. The three cities have been under a perimetral lockdown for two weeks. Last week, Barbón shut the borders of the region, ordered stores to close by 10pm, and hostelry establishments and betting parlors by 11pm. He also restricted social gatherings to six people. Other regions consider home confinement Asturias is the first region to publicly call for home confinement, although others have raised the possibility. The head of Melilla, Eduardo de Castro, formally requested the measure on Sunday in a letter to Illa. In relative terms, Melilla is the Spanish territory with the highest number of coronavirus cases and the greatest pressure on hospitals. Last week, the health chief of Castilla y León, Verónica Casado, said the region was considering “scheduling” home confinement for 14-day periods, and had asked the central government for the legal tools required to apply this measure if there was no improvement in the region’s epidemiological data.

", "3": "The Spanish youths who cleaned up after vandals protesting coronavirus restrictions A group of teens has drawn praise from Spain’s politicians after volunteering to help deal with the fallout of street disturbances in the northern city of Logroño Armed with trash bags, brooms and rubber gloves, a group of volunteers led by a 16-year-old on Sunday created an improvised clean-up team that helped municipal workers deal with the fallout of acts of vandalism in Logroño, Spain. The spontaneous act of solidarity emerged after a weekend of street rioting in Barcelona, Bilbao, Logroño, Málaga, Valencia, Santander and other parts of Spain where people were protesting the curfew introduced by the government to contain the spread of the coronavirus. El Espolón, the most popular city square in Logroño – the capital of the small region of La Rioja, home to the world-famous red wines – was littered with sticks and stones. There was also extensive damage to street furniture caused by around 150 violent youths from anti-globalization and far-right movements who showed at the protest, burned trash containers and threw rocks at the police. Seven officers were injured and seven individuals have been arrested in connection with the incidents. Pablo and his friends were witness to the events. “I felt very ashamed, because that wasn’t a demonstration, it was just pure vandalism,” recalls Pablo Alcaide, the 16-year-old who coordinated the volunteer effort. “Not all young people are vandals. My mother is a street sweeper and I know how hard it is to keep the city clean.” So he made a call to other teens on social media to help clean up the city. “The reply was phenomenal, more than 20 people showed up,” says Pablo. “We broke up in groups of six, wearing face masks.” The initiative has drawn praise from local residents and even from Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez of the Socialist Party (PSOE), from opposition leader Pablo Casado of the Popular Party (PP) and from the regional premier of La Rioja, Concha Andreu of the PSOE. La juventud de nuestro país es esto: generosidad, responsabilidad, compromiso. Valores que nos engrandecen como sociedad.Gracias por vuestra admirable reacción hoy en La Rioja.Nuestra fuerza está en poder contar los unos con los otros. Sigamos combatiendo al virus con unidad. https://t.co/PBt53T7KVz “Our country’s youth is this: generosity, a sense of responsibility, commitment. Values that make us greater as a society. Thank you for your admirable reaction today in La Rioja. Our strength resides in being able to count on one another. Let’s keep fighting the virus with unity,” tweeted Sánchez. “I didn’t think it was going to have this kind of repercussion. Our intention was just to do something for our town,” says Pablo. “Not all young people are the same; while some go around breaking the city, others help restore the image that it deserves.” English version by Susana Urra.", "4": "Spain has recorded third-highest coronavirus fatality rate in Europe since July  Only Romania and the Czech Republic have registered more Covid-19 deaths per inhabitant. If the trend continues, there will be 8,000 more official victims by Christmas  Spain has added 7,100 coronavirus fatalities to the official death toll since July. This equates to 15 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants – the third-highest fatality rate per 100,000 inhabitants in Europe. In Germany, this figure is 10 times lower, and in Italy, it is just one-third of the rate in Spain. Portugal (eight), France (nine) and Belgium (12) are the European countries with the closest fatality rate per 100,000 inhabitants. What’s more, Spain reported an average of 150 daily Covid-19 related fatalities last week, making the virus the leading cause of death. The only two European countries with a higher coronavirus fatality rate per 100,000 inhabitants are Romania and the Czech Republic, which both saw a relatively low number of deaths in the first wave of the pandemic between March and June. But the number of coronavirus victims must be considered with care: the figure Spain reports to European institutions is based on information from the Health Ministry, which has had ongoing problems with underreporting and notification delays. For example, the Health Ministry’s official death count is 30% lower than the number reported by Spain’s regions. Yet even with these problems, Spain recorded a daily average of 150 official coronavirus deaths last week. This figure is equal to all the deaths caused by respiratory illnesses in 2019 and is 10 times higher than the number of fatalities caused by traffic accidents in 1996, which was one of the worst years on record. If the rate does not slow, Spain will have recorded 8,000 more Covid-19 fatalities by Christmas. Spain only adds victims to the official toll if they have tested positive for the coronavirus. The second wave of the pandemic has not hit all of Europe at the same time. Spain was one of the first to be affected. In France and Italy, coronavirus cases began to rise two to three weeks later. Typically, the number of fatalities start after a spike in cases, which leads to more hospital admissions and later deaths. Both France and Italy are trying to stop this from happening with new restrictions, the former with a total lockdown, and the latter by closing all establishments at 6pm. The next graphic shows how the number of daily reported coronavirus deaths has risen in 16 European countries, with the European average in grey. The epidemiological curve in Spain is following a pattern that is very different from most countries in Europe. In August, the number of coronavirus infections rose more quickly than any other territory and by the beginning of September, the Madrid region had the highest cumulative number of cases in the continent. But just as France and Belgium began to report more cases, the number dropped in Madrid and plateaued nationally. This has been attributed to the first round of coronavirus restrictions introduced during the second wave and also to fear: perhaps the alarming data from August made Spaniards more cautious in September. The weather may have also played a role: if the cold and more indoor activity is behind the rise in Europe, it is not a surprise that Spain’s warm weather has delayed these effects. But since October, the number of hospital admissions and deaths has once again spiked: coronavirus cases and hospitalizations have nearly doubled. Case fatality rate The first table also shows the case fatality ratio or rate (CFR) in each European country since July. This represents the number of deaths out of all confirmed cases. In Spain, this figure has been around 0.8% since July. In other words, for every 100 confirmed diagnoses, nearly one person has died. The CFR in Spain is slightly higher than the average. Romania, Bulgaria and Hungary have worse figures, given that it is likely that many coronavirus cases are going undetected in these countries. Spain, however, is still a long way off from Germany, where the CFR has been 0.4% since July. These figures are an approximation: the CFR will rise in Spain as many recently contracted coronavirus infections have not yet had the time to cause deaths. Covid-19 fatalities also tend to be reported with more delays than new cases. It’s also important to differentiate between the case fatality ratio and the infection fatality ratio (IFR). The IFR addresses an important question: what percentage of infected people will end up losing their lives to the disease? To determine this figure, one must know how many infections have not been detected, because they are asymptomatic or have not gone to the doctor. Last week, the Imperial College London published a detailed study that estimated the IFR in high-income countries during the first wave of the pandemic. According to the researchers, this figure was around 1.1% of all infections, taking into account undetected cases, based on seroprevalence studies. The study also points out that the IFR of the flu is at least 10 times lower, standing at less than 0.1%, according to data from the United States. Differences between Spain’s regions The coronavirus fatality rate since July varies greatly between each region in Spain. Aragón was hit by the second wave earlier, with outbreaks among seasonal workers in July. The incidence rate has since stabilized, but has never truly dropped. Meanwhile, the number of deaths in the region has continued to rise. Since July, Aragón has had the worst fatality rate per population of Spain’s 17 regions: 54 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants. This is nearly double the figure in Castilla y León (32), Madrid (30), La Rioja (29), Navarre (26) and Basque Country (23). At the other end of the spectrum are the Canary Islands and Valencia, where the fatality rate per 100,000 inhabitants has been four to five times lower. It is also important to remember that the official coronavirus death toll does not reflect the entire impact of the pandemic. This is firstly due to the aforementioned problems with reporting Covid-19 deaths. The most extreme case is Catalonia: the region has only reported to the Health Ministry 306 coronavirus deaths confirmed by PCR tests since July. This represents only 20% of the 1,400 fatalities “suspected” to have been caused by Covid-19, a figure that is likely to be more accurate as it is in line with the fatality rate of other European regions. The other point to consider is the number of excess deaths according to the civil registries. During the second wave, the National Statistics Institute (INE) recorded 13,000 more deaths than in 2019 and 2010. This figure accounts for deaths from all causes, but is likely to include coronavirus fatalities that were not added to the official toll, as well as the likely rise in victims from other diseases, who were not diagnosed or received worse treatment as a result of the coronavirus crisis. They are excess deaths that, while not all attributable to Covid-19, are likely to have been caused by the health crisis provoked by the pandemic.", "5": "Boat arrivals in Spain’s Canary Islands spark rise in anti-migrant rhetoric Local residents have been protesting the government’s management of migrant facilities, while experts warn about the risk of ‘democratic racism’ and political profiteering by the far right “No to illegal immigration!” screamed a man in a cowboy hat into a loudspeaker. “This is a real invasion,” added Soledad Caballero, a housewife draped with a Spanish flag. “They’ve sent 296 immigrants to live 50 meters from my house. I’m not saying it’s them, but lately there have been thefts.” Both were taking part in a protest march in Arguineguín, a village of 2,500 residents that is is part of the tourist town of Mogán, in the southwest area of the island of Gran Canaria in Spain’s Canary Islands. Since late August, this spot has become an involuntary center of immigration from Africa: over 1,300 people are crowded at emergency port facilities meant to hold no more than 600. Local authorities estimate that around 1,100 people marched on Saturday in a protest that had been organized by the Arguineguín Neighborhood Association. During the demonstration, some protesters asked for more aid for the migrants, but many others used terms such as “illegal,” “invaders” and “parasites.” There were also many calls for Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez of the Socialist Party (PSOE) to resign. “I have nothing against the immigrants, but if there isn’t enough to go around for us, how can there be enough for them?” said Verónica, a sales clerk who is currently out of a job. Meanwhile, the mayor of Mogán, Onalia Bueno, reminded marchers that racist comments were out of place. “There is no room here for anything that’s not fighting for human rights,” she said over the loudspeaker. Record arrivals Around 12,000 African migrants have arrived in the Canary Islands this year, the biggest figure since the so-called “cayuco crisis,” after the makeshift vessels used by the migrants, of 2006. Around 10% of these individuals ended up at this spot. This past week alone, there were 1,400 new arrivals. The situation is causing tension between the regional government and central authorities, and anger among the local population. “We are incensed at the lack of action by the Spanish government,” said the mayor of Mogán in statements made in September, when there was another peak in arrivals to the archipelago from the western coast of Africa, which is located 100 kilometers away from the closest island. “We understand that the government delegation here is overwhelmed, but there are no decent facilities for them here. Europe cannot allow this kind of policy,” she said. Some locals have drawn comparisons with the Greek island of Lesbos, where thousands of refugees fleeing war-torn countries have been living in overcrowded camps for years. “If they think we’re going to let this turn into a Lesbos, they’ve got another think coming,” said Arguineguín resident Antonio L. Last month Manuel Santana, who runs the Fishermen Association’s restaurant in Arguineguín, warned that “the village is about to do a tunte,” alluding to incidents that took place in July in the village of Tunte, also on the island of Gran Canaria, where local residents confronted law enforcement officers over the removal of one group of migrants who had been there for months and with whom they had a friendly relationship, and the arrival of a new group, who were feared to be carrying the coronavirus. ‘Democratic racism’ The anger over poor management of migrant arrivals is now compounded by the uncertainty created by the coronavirus crisis. “There are elements of concern,” says Daniel Buraschi, a member of the Social Action and Research Network (RAIS) and co-author of the book Racismo y Antirracismo Comprender para Transformar (or Racism and Antiracism: Understanding in order to Transform). Buraschi talks about the concept of ‘democratic racism.’ “It excludes migrant people by appealing to democratic values, so that the violation of their rights becomes justifiable,” he explains. “For instance, by talking about the health threat and justifying radical measures based on a pseudo-principle of justice, with arguments like ‘immigrants receive too much’ or ‘the government has abandoned us, but it puts them up at a hotel.’ This mobilizes resentment on the basis of legitimate principles such as the right to healthcare or concern about the economy.” The difficulty lies in calling these people racist. “The only thing we’d achieve is to increase their resentment, because they don’t see themselves that way and they feel that we are not acknowledging their indignation. And this resentment can act as a catalyst.” Political profit Spain’s far-right party Vox has been trying to capitalize on this discontent. Its deputy for Las Palmas, Alberto Rodríguez Almeida, was one of the very few politicians who took part in the march last Saturday. “The lack of action by this government has allowed this trend to get out of hand,” he said during the protest. Antonio Morales, head of the island council of Gran Canaria, fears that the far right could benefit from the situation and admits that more could have been done to prevent it. Nasara Cabrera Abu, director general of Economic Affairs with Africa, agrees. “There is far-right rhetoric that’s opened up a new scenario legitimizing this kind of action and less politically correct speech,” she notes. “Strategies are required to work on integration values. I support making diversity management part of public policy. The African population is no more than 8% of the total foreign population, so the terms employed in the media, such as ‘avalanche,’ do not reflect the real situation.” Role of social media Social media play a key role in propagating these fears, according to a recent report by the Tenerife Immigration Observatory. “The broad dissemination of online hate represents a dangerous breeding ground for racism and xenophobia,” reads the report. Migrants arrivals are not just being covered by traditional media, but “also by people who record images and add contemptuous, violent and discriminatory comments.” “People are getting erroneous information that is not fact-checked, and this creates an imaginary concept and a fear of the poor person who’s coming to take away what’s ours,” says Cabrera Abu. “And this can be used for political profit.” English version by Susana Urra.", "6": "Police make 32 arrests in Madrid, after second night of disturbances across Spain Violent demonstrators have taken to the streets this weekend in cities including Barcelona, Bilbao and Málaga to protest coronavirus restrictions such as the nighttime curfew A total of 32 people were arrested in the center of Madrid on Saturday night, after an unauthorized demonstration took place to protest against the nationwide curfew that has been put in place across Spain in a bid to curb the spread of the coronavirus. The disturbances came after similar scenes in other Spanish cities over the weekend, including Barcelona, Bilbao, Logroño, Málaga, Valencia and Santander, among others. The demonstrators in Madrid set fire to trash containers in the capital’s Gran Vía boulevard as well as damaging store fronts and other commercial premises – in particular banks – in the area. Three National Police officers were left with light injuries, according to a spokesperson from the central government’s delegate in Madrid. The protest had not been officially communicated to the delegation, and was organized via social media. The demonstrators chanted slogans such as: “Madrid says enough,” “Stop the political mafia, stop the dictatorship,” and “Madrid is being ruined,” among others. At around 10pm, officers cleared the protestors from the central Puerta del Sol square, and the crowds moved to the Plaza de Isabel II. There, a hundred or so people chanted slogans against the Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez. Some of them then moved to the Plaza de España, where they set fire to trash containers and tried to use barricades to cut off the Gran Vía. Street chases then ensued and protestors threw objects at police vehicles. The situation lasted around 20 minutes. Those arrested face public order and damages offenses. 📌El @DGobiernoMadrid @conJoseMFranco ha estado en permanente comunicación con Jefatura Superior de @policia en #Madrid para conocer de primera mano las protestas que se han llevado a cabo en la Puerta del Sol y Gran Vía para disolverlas de manera pacífica al no estar comunicadas pic.twitter.com/2UTz9O0xY8 A tweet from the central government delegation in Madrid with images of the disturbances. Meanwhile, in the northern city of Bilbao there were four arrests at similar protests. In Vitoria, there were acts of vandalism in the center of the city while in San Sebastián demonstrators also set fire to trash containers. The central government delegate in La Rioja reported that seven National Police officers were injured after serious incidents in the city of Logroño, with at least six people arrested. In Málaga there was also damage caused by protestors and fires were set. Four people were arrested and an officer was injured in Santander, where 50 people demonstrated against the restrictions in the central Ayuntamiento square. Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez has spoken out against the violence and called the “violent and irrational” behavior “intolerable,” and perpetrated by violent minority groups. “This is not the path,” he wrote on Saturday via Twitter, calling for “responsibility, unity and sacrifice” in order to beat the pandemic. The violent scenes began on Friday night in Barcelona, when another unannounced protest saw “very violent and organized far-right groups” meet in the Plaza Sant Jaume square, according to the head of the regional police, Pere Ferrer. Some of the demonstrators threw barriers and fireworks at officers, and police charges ended with 12 arrests, including two minors. There were similar protests on Friday night in Burgos and Cantabria. Based on reporting by F. Javier Barroso, Rebeca Carranco, Juan Navarro. English version by Simon Hunter.", "7": "New coronavirus cases in Spain hit record high, with 25,595 reported by the Health Ministry on Friday Experts say that the new measures introduced this week, including a curfew and perimetral confinements of regions, have arrived too late and that more total lockdowns should be considered The coronavirus continues to spread through Spain, despite the battery of measures taken in recent weeks to combat it. On Friday, ahead of what will be a long weekend in several regions due to the All Saints holiday, the Health Ministry reported 25,595 new infections, a record high for the pandemia so far. In total, 139,546 positives have been reported in the last seven days, also the worst figure on record. The previous high was 109,572. What’s more, 239 victims were added on Friday to the overall death toll, bringing the total to 35,878. Based on figures for excess deaths, however, the real number is likely to be closer to 60,000. Given the increase in cases, the 14-day cumulative number of coronavirus cases per 100,000 inhabitants also hit a new high on Friday: 485.28. The incidence is only falling in the Canary Islands, Madrid and Melilla, and is rising in all other regions. In the Canaries, the 14-day cumulative number of coronavirus cases per 100,000 inhabitants is around 75; in Madrid it is 414.9; and in the North African city of Melilla it is 1,276. Aragón and Navarre have also both now passed the 1,000-mark for the data point. Other indicators are equally poor. The percentage of hospital beds occupied by Covid-19 patients and those in intensive care units (ICUs) are also at record highs, with 14.73% and 26.59%, respectively. There are 18,162 people hospitalized with coronavirus, nearly 600 more than on Thursday. These data points usually reflect the number of new cases with two or three weeks of delay. This means that even if diagnosed cases begin to fall next week, hospital admissions will be rising for one or two weeks before any improvement is noted. This data backs the need to limit mobility over this holiday weekend, in order not to worsen the situation. Weekly cases – taken from Saturday to Friday, in order to be able to compare with this Friday’s data – came in at around 70,000 from the end of September until the middle of October. In two weeks they have almost doubled. Last Sunday, the Spanish government implemented a new state of alarm that will permit the regional administrations to apply restrictions without being challenged by the courts. In recent days, the regions have toughened their coronavirus measures, with a nighttime curfew in place, and perimetral lockdowns in many territories and even municipalities or neighborhoods. Only residents of the Canary and Balearic Islands, Galicia and Extremadura can freely leave their regions. The country’s nightlife has also been suspended, there are capacity limits in place, bar counters have been closed and social meetings are limited to six people. All of these measures are aimed at preventing another total lockdown like the one put in place in March – or at least similar to that one, as it appears schools would remain open even in the case of a total confinement. That’s the intention, at least, of Health Minister Salvador Illa, who on Friday morning stated that another domestic lockdown “will not be necessary.” “The regions have taken forceful measures and I am sure that they will bring results,” he said. The state of alarm, he added, achieved a “framework of stability with very powerful measures,” and called for time for these restrictions, such as the curfew, to take effect. Given the nature of the virus, the idea is to wait around two weeks, which is the usual period between an infection and symptoms manifesting. Getting ahead of the virus This optimism is not shared by many experts. “We are late implementing these measures,” says Patricia Guillem, a professor in epidemiology from Valencia’s Universidad Europea. “We should have acted quicker given the numbers from each regions and focussing on those that had a bigger population density and where cases were rising more rapidly. We should opt for solutions like those of Germany [closure of bars and restaurants for a month] and France [national lockdown] and implement a strict confinement in order to get the numbers under control. After that we could talk about perimetral confinements, but right now we need to move quickly to get ahead of the virus and not to be behind it.” This viewpoint is shared by Daniel López-Acuña, a former official at the World Health Organization (WHO), former general secretary of the Health Ministry José Martínez Olmos, and Alberto Infante, the former general director of the ministry’s Quality Agency. The three agree that a lockdown of at least 15 days should be considered for those areas where the healthcare system is close to collapse. “A curfew is a starting point, but we have to be open to even more restrictive measures if the curve does not stabilize in the coming days,” says López-Acuña, who proposes scaled measures. First, “curfew or total lockdown over the weekend;” then, “as well as a curfew, return to Phase 1 of the deescalation process with stricter restrictions during daytime hours;” and finally, “return to a total lockdown in the most-affected areas for a short period.” And finally, “total lockdown for the entire population as there was from March to June.” All of this with weekly evaluations in order to be able to get ahead of the situation. “The objective is to reach a cumulative incidence of fewer than 25 cases per 100,000 inhabitants as soon as possible,” he adds. “But we have to be aware that this will take weeks.” English version by Simon Hunter.", "8": "Spanish economy sees record-high quarterly rise, but remains far from pre-crisis levels  Gross domestic product rose 16.7% between July and September, but the recovery is likely to be short term as Spain faces a new round of coronavirus restrictions  The Spanish economy recorded a 16.7% rise in gross domestic product (GDP) in the third quarter of 2020 – the highest quarterly increase of the historical series. The spike in output has been attributed to the relaxation of coronavirus restrictions and the government’s ERTE furlough scheme, which is aimed at preventing layoffs and business closures. In the second quarter, between April and June, Spain’s economy ground to a halt due to the restrictions aimed at slowing the spread of the coronavirus, such as the closure of all public-facing business and the one-week hibernation of non-essential work, which ended on April 9. After falling significantly in this period, the economy rebounded between July and September as these measures were eased and lifted. But the celebrations are likely to be short-lived. Spain is still far from where it was before it was hit by the coronavirus pandemic. After shrinking nearly 25% in the first half of the year, the economy has only recovered 59% of what it lost. In the third quarter, GDP fell 8.7% compared to the same period of 2019 – double the Eurozone average. What’s more, with coronavirus cases continuing to rise, the country is facing a new range of restrictions, which could hurt the upward trend. The 16.7% quarterly rise in GDP exceeds the predictions of both the government, which forecast an increase of 13%, and most studies. “The data we have seen this week shows a strong recovery of the economy and employment during the third quarter,” said Finance Minister Nadia Calviño on Friday. But she warned: “We are facing a moment of great uncertainty both at a European and global level.” In normal times, a quarterly rise of 16.7% would be considered an amazing accomplishment. But amid the coronavirus crisis, it seems more like a bandage over an open wound. Spain’s tourism industry – which accounts for close to 12% of the country’s GDP – saw its worst summer season on record due to the pandemic. As Spain recorded a rise in coronavirus cases, a number of nations warned against travel to Spain and introduced quarantine measures for visitors to the country – notably the United Kingdom and Germany. As a result, the tourism industry fell by nearly 70% and lost up to €40 billion in revenue. But this was not enough to stop the economy from rebounding – a recovery that was in large part guaranteed given the hibernation of the economy in the first week of April. According to the National Statistics Institute (INE), the rebound was driven mainly by national demand, which rose 11 points with respect to the previous quarter. External demand, by contrast, only increased 1.8 points upon the second quarter. Other significant rises were reported in the manufacturing industry (33%), investment (16.3%) and household consumption (20.7%), as well as services in trade, transportation and the hostelry sector (42.5%). Over the summer, 569,600 jobs were created and 80% of workers on the government’s ERTE furlough scheme have returned to work. Under this plan, companies suffering losses from the Covid-19 pandemic and the confinement measures can temporarily send home workers or reduce their working hours. The unemployment rate in Spain currently stands at 16.3%. “The growth of GDP in the third quarter confirms forecasts of an initial recovery after the fall in the second quarter. But despite this, the Spanish economy has recovered just half of what it lost in the first half of the year,” warned Ángel Talavera, the head of analysis at Oxford Economics for Europe. Technically Spain is coming out of the recession, but that does not mean there is reason to celebrate. Spain’s economic recovery is looking increasingly less like a V, with the second wave of the pandemic threatening to cause more damage as lockdown measures become increasingly more frequent and restrictive. The greater the number of restrictions, the worse the blow to the economy. “The forecasts for the fourth quarter are worsening rapidly and we could see a new fall in activity, albeit a much smaller one than the one we suffered at the beginning of the year,” explained Talavera. “Returning GDP to the level it was before the crisis is going to take a long time and may not happen until 2023.” English version by Melissa Kitson.", "9": "State of alarm: All the latest coronavirus restrictions in Spain, region by region   Here is a guide to the measures that have been introduced by each regional government in a bid to slow the spread of the virus The state of alarm implemented on Sunday by the central government grants Spain’s regions the legal instruments they need to take measures aimed at controlling the coronavirus pandemic without having to rely on the ratification of the courts. As well as a nighttime curfew, which is currently in place everywhere except the Canary Islands, the decree allows for the regions to shut their borders, as well as introducing perimetral lockdowns in provinces, municipalities and neighborhoods. Each region can also maintain its restrictions on capacity, opening hours and social meetings. Here are the main restrictions in place at the current time. Andalusia. A perimetral confinement has been put in place around the region from 12am Friday morning until November 9. The regional government has also confined the provinces of Seville, Granada and Jaén, and all their municipalities, as well as the health districts of Córdoba Sur, La Vega de Granada and Jerez-Costa Noroeste and Sierra de Cádiz. In total, the measures affect 450 of the 785 municipalities in Andalusia. The curfew is in place from 11pm to 6am in the whole region, with hostelry establishments having to close at 10.30pm and a limit of six people who can meet in public or private, unless they live together. Aragón. A perimetral confinement has been in place around the region from Tuesday, and will last until November 9. What’s more, the cities of Huesca, Zaragoza and Teruel are also confined, a measure that was put in place last Thursday. The region is at Level 3 of the coronavirus alarm system, the most restrictive, meaning sidewalk cafés are limited to 50% capacity, hostelry inside at 25%, and closing times at 10pm. Social groups are limited to six people, and the curfew runs from 11pm to 6am. Asturias. The region has imposed a perimetral lockdown, a measure also in effect in the cities of Oviedo, Gijón and Avilés until November 7. Commercial activity must cease at 10pm, while hostelry establishments and betting houses must close at 11pm. The regional government has called on the population to form social bubbles to curb the spread of infections. The limit for meetings in public and private is six people. The curfew is in place from 11pm to 6am. Balearic Islands. The curfew, from midnight to 6am, also dictates the closing time for bars and restaurants, with capacity in hostelry at 50% if the maximum allowed is 50 people and 75% if it is less than 50. The same restrictions apply to sidewalk cafés. Social meetings are limited to six people, smoking in public is banned as is bar service in establishments. Capacity in places of worship is limited to 30%. The municipality of Manacor has been confined for 15 days given the rise in cases there. Canary Islands. The Canaries are the only region where there is no nighttime curfew in place. The islands also have no confinement measures in place. Nighttime bars and clubs have been prohibited since the summer. Only Tenerife is currently on a red alert according to the coronavirus alarm system, meaning that hostelry establishments must close at midnight and restrict large groups. On the rest of the islands, the closing time is one hour later, with tables limited to 10 people. Commercial establishments must limit capacity to 75%. Cantabria. The region will be subject to a perimetral lockdown to bring down coronavirus infections. The curfew is in place from midnight to 6am, with hostelry establishments closing at midnight. Social meetings are limited to six people. Castilla-La Mancha. The region is subject to a perimetral lockdown until November 9. The curfew is in place from midnight to 6am and social meetings are limited to six people. Level 1 of the coronavirus restrictions – reduction on capacity in bars, cultural activities and commercial areas – are in place in Villahermosa and Campo de Criptana; Almagro is at level two (tougher restrictions than Level 1, with no bar service); while Azuqueca de Henares and the city of Guadalajara continue at Level 2 of the alert system. Castilla y León. The region will be confined from today until November 9, with premier Alfonso Fernández Mañueco calling for “intelligent self-confinement,” reducing social contact to the minimum. The curfew runs from 10pm to 6am. The perimetral confinements of León, Burgos, Salamanca and Palencia have been suspended. Hostelry establishments must close at 10pm, with capacity limited to 50% in all establishments. Social meetings are limited to six people. Catalonia. The regional government has also implemented a perimetral lockdown of the territory, which will last for 15 days. There are plans to suspend all extra-curricular, cultural and sporting activities (including gyms), and there will also be restrictions on non-essential businesses. Experts are analyzing how these measures will fit within the extension to the state of alarm approved on Thursday by the Congress of Deputies, Spain’s lower house of parliament. The curfew is in place from 10pm to 6am, and commercial establishments must close to the public at 9pm, as must recreational and sporting activities. Cinemas can finish at 10pm, and patrons have until 11pm to return home. Bars and restaurants are closed in Catalonia, but home delivery is permitted until 10pm. Capacity is set at 50% in cultural activities, religious acts, civil ceremonies, sports installations and common spaces in hotels, and at 30% in retail outlets. Social meetings are limited to six people. Valencia. The region will introduce a perimetral lockdown from midday Friday, which will last seven days but will allow for movement between municipalities. The curfew is in place from midnight to 6am and social meetings are limited to six people, apart from those who live together, until December 9. The official recommendation is for people to meet outside or in well-ventilated areas, and to cancel any non-essential activities. Hostelry must close at midnight, and orders are not permitted after 11pm. Masks are obligatory at tables apart from when eating or drinking, and bar service is not permitted. Capacity in hostelry is limited to 75% inside, and 100% outside provided safe distance between tables is observed. Establishments and other businesses are limited to 75% of capacity. Gardens and other outdoor areas can open from 8am to 10pm. Alcohol cannot be sold between 10pm and 8am apart from in hostelry establishments. Extremadura. The curfew is in place from midnight to 6am and social meetings are limited to six people. There are no plans for a perimetral lockdown of the region. Mérida, Cáceres and Badajoz are subject to capacity restrictions in bars, while several municipalities have perimetral lockdowns: Cáceres (Cilleros, Hoyos, Perales del Puerto, Cabezuela del Valle, Jerte, Tornavacas, Jarandilla de la Vera, Talaveruela de la Vera, Valverde de la Vera, Villanueva de la Vera, Madrigal de la Vera, Hervás, Alcuéscar and Arroyomolinos) and in Badajoz ( La Roca de la Sierra, Almendralejo, Usagre and Villanueva del Fresno). Galicia. On Friday, the Galician regional government announced that the cities of Santiago, A Coruña, Arteixo, Pontevedra, Vigo, Lugo, Poio, Marín, Ames, Teo and Vimianzo would be placed under a perimetral lockdown. The curfew in this region runs from 11pm to 6am, with meetings limited to five people. Cultural venues such as cinemas and theaters are limited to 50% of capacity, as are businesses and bars where counter service is not allowed. In Santiago and O Milladoiro, social meetings are not permitted unless they are with people you live with. Sidewalk cafés in these areas are limited to 50% of capacity with indoor consumption banned. Ourense and Barbadàs also have perimetral confinements in place, as do O Carballiño, O Irixo and Boborás, where all leisure, culture and sports sites were closed on Thursday. This week, Verín, Oímbra and Vilardevós (also in Ourense) were also subjected to perimetral confinements. La Rioja. The region is under a perimetral confinement, which is due to stay in place until November 7. Logroño and Arnedo have also been confined, with bars closed for a month. The region has limited social meetings to six people, with the curfew in place from 11pm to 6am. Establishments must close at 9pm, apart from pharmacies, supermarkets and restaurants offering home delivery. Hostelry must reduce capacity to 50% inside and 60% outside, and bar counters may not be used. Alcohol cannot be sold after 10pm. Madrid. The central government has allowed Madrid to close its borders for just the holiday weekend, meaning Madrileños cannot go anywhere on October 30 and 31, and November 1 and 2. A decision is yet to be taken on what will happen next weekend, given that Monday is also a regional holiday. A selective confinement is also in place in 32 basic healthcare areas, 19 of which are in the capital – residents cannot leave without justification, nor can people enter. In these areas, children’s play parks are closed and sidewalk cafés are limited to 50% capacity.  On Friday, three more healthcare areas were added, bringing the total to 35. They are: Valle de la Oliva in Majadahonda and two areas of Coslada: Barrio del Puerto and Doctor Tamames Stores must close at 10pm across the region and bars and restaurants at midnight. Capacity in commercial establishments is 75% in general and 50% in the healthcare areas with restrictions. A curfew is in place from midnight to 6am. Social meetings in homes between people who do not live together are permitted, but limited to six people. Murcia. The perimetral confinement, in this case, applies to the region and all 45 of its municipalities, meaning no residents can leave their areas unless it is for justified reasons such as work or to seek medical assistance. Ten municipalities – Abanilla, Archena, Beniel, Bullas, Ceutí, Cieza, Fortuna, Lorquí, Torre Pacheco and Totana – have closed the interiors of all bars and restaurants, with only sidewalk cafés allowed to serve customers. All of these measures went into place on Thursday night and will be in place until November 9, but the regional government has warned they could be extended according to the progress of the pandemic. Navarre. All hostelry establishments are closed in this region, with the curfew in place from 11pm to 6am. Shopping malls are limited to 40% capacity. Visits to senior residences have been suspended, with 30% capacity inside and 40% capacity outside for gyms and sports facilities, with a ban on using locker rooms (apart from at swimming pools). Public transport is limited to 50% capacity. Internal mobility in the region is still permitted. Basque Country. A perimetral confinement of the region is in place, as well as for all municipalities, meaning that citizens cannot leave their areas unless for justified reasons. Social meetings are limited to six people and alcohol cannot be sold between 8pm and 8am. The curfew is in place between 11pm and 6am.

English version by Simon Hunter.", "10": "Spain’s new state of alarm: more regions close their borders  Aragón, Asturias and the Basque Country join Navarre and La Rioja in sealing their territory, while Catalonia is considering weekend home confinements The state of alarm decreed on Sunday in Spain to curb the coronavirus pandemic gives regional governments the legal tools to take the mobility-restricting measures they consider necessary, such as closing city limits or even the borders of an entire region. Until now, regional authorities seeking such measures had been forced to request permission from a court on a case-by-case basis. But the new legal framework is triggering border closures in a growing number of Spanish regions, with more expected in the coming days. Using this new tool, Aragón, Asturias and the Basque Country on Monday said they would seal their own borders, allowing only essential travel in and out of their territory. Aragón’s perimetral confinement began on Monday night and will last at least two weeks, while in Asturias it will start on Tuesday night. The Basque government announced the closure of its borders starting at 6am on Tuesday. Additionally, residents of the Basque Country will be confined to their own municipalities except for justified reasons involving work, health, education or caring for seniors and dependents. Two other regions, Navarre and La Rioja, had already closed off their territory last week after seeking court authorization. Madrid, Andalusia and Castilla y León are also about to introduce restrictions. Besides giving regional officials the authority to restrict mobility, Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez of the Socialist Party (PSOE) has also introduced a 15-day curfew across the entire territory with the sole exception of the Canary Islands because of its significantly better epidemiological data. The nighttime confinement has been established from 11pm to 6am, although regional authorities may push the start and end time one hour ahead or back as they see fit. This is the second time that Spain has activated the lowest of three existing states of emergency in a bid to curb the coronavirus pandemic. The first time was in mid-March, when the government introduced a strict home confinement and brought the economy nearly to a halt. This time, authorities are hoping there will be no need for such stringent measures. There is no home confinement, but social gatherings are restricted to six people and in some cases, people cannot enter or leave a specific area – a healthcare division, a municipality or a region – without a justified cause. While there is some overlap between central and regional measures, Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez wants the regions, which have devolved powers over healthcare, to take the initiative in controlling the pandemic. Here is a breakdown of existing and planned measures in each region of Spain. On Tuesday morning, regional premier Juan Manuel Moreno of the Popular Party (PP) suggested that Andalusia’s borders could soon be closed. Speaking on the Cope radio network, Moreno said he was “very pessimistic” about the possibility of maintaining unrestricted mobility in and out of Andalusia because of the negative epidemiological and hospitalization figures, but added that a decision has not been made yet. In Spain’s most populated region, there is one clear coronavirus hotspot: the city of Granada, where the 14-day cumulative number of coronavirus cases is 976 per 100,000 inhabitants. The regional government last week introduced an 11pm-6am curfew on the entire metropolitan area, affecting the provincial capital and 32 municipalities that are home to around 500,000 people. This same area is also subject to a two-week perimetral lockdown, meaning that residents can only leave for essential business. With the new state of alarm in effect, the entire region is now under an 11pm-to-6am curfew, although these times could soon change, the government said. Madrid regional officials said they will close the region’s borders on two upcoming long weekends to prevent mass travel. Residents of the Madrid region will not be able to go elsewhere from October 30 to November 2, and again from November 7 to November 9, when Madrileños are observing a regional holiday.  On Saturday, the Madrid region emerged from its own state of alarm imposed earlier by the central government. Under the new, nationwide state of alarm, there is a midnight-to-6am curfew in place. Díaz Ayuso has also reintroduced a type of perimetral confinement that is based on healthcare areas, administrative divisions that may include one or more healthcare centers. As of Monday, residents of 32 of these areas can only go in and out for justified reasons. These areas are located in 11 municipalities in the Madrid region, including the capital. The Catalan government has approved new restrictions that include a perimetral confinement of the entire region, with a plan for even stricter measures in each municipality on weekends. The Catalan government has also decided that the curfew will extend from 10pm to 6am. Stores must close to the public by 9pm except for theaters, auditoriums and other cultural venues, which may do so one hour later. There were already limits on social gatherings and business capacity, and these remain in place. And in mid-October, bars and restaurants were forced to close in a bid to reduce social gatherings. The Catalan government spokeswoman, Meritxell Budó, on Monday admitted that authorities are also considering the option of weekend home confinements in order to curb contagion. Budó said that Spain’s new state of alarm does not go far enough because it “limits the decisions that the government of Catalonia can take.” The head of Aragón, Javier Lambán of the PSOE, on Monday announced that the regional borders will be sealed at midnight and remain closed for at least 15 days, until November 9. “It would be reckless to soften up the [measures],” said Lambán to justify the decision. The regional leader said that this week and the next will be “key to flattening the curve of contagion,” but he ruled out the possibility of weekend home confinements. “It’s not something we are considering,” he said. Aragón has the third-highest 14-day coronavirus incidence after Navarre and the exclave city of Melilla (682.18 cases per 100,000 inhabitants). Last week the government confined the cities of Huesca, Zaragoza and Teruel. Residents of other parts of Aragón may still move freely throughout the region, but travel in and out of Aragón itself is restricted to essential activities. The 11pm-6am curfew also went into effect last night, although the government is considering the possibility of changing the start time. The government of Adrián Barbón of the PSOE on Monday afternoon announced a regional border closure that will take effect on Tuesday night. At a news conference, Barbón said that the goal is to flatten the curve, avoid pushing hospitals to the breaking point, and “avoid having to be confined at home.” The residents of Oviedo, Gijón and Avilés are already confined to their own cities and due to remain so until November 7. Around 80% of the small region’s population live in the triangle formed by these three cities. Until recently, Asturias had had the lowest coronavirus incidence in Spain, but it has recently started to spike and now stands at 300.84 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. Commercial establishments must close by 10pm, while food and drink venues as well as betting parlors must do so at 11pm. Barbón is also pushing back the curfew to midnight. Regional premier Ximo Puig of the PSOE said there were no major incidents to report on the first night of curfew, which begins at midnight. Puig, who introduced a curfew ahead of Sánchez’s declaration on Sunday, is planning to extend the rules until December 9. There are also restrictions on social gatherings and businesses. The main restrictions besides the national curfew are a limit of six people for social gatherings, no smoking on the streets and no bar counter service, as well as 30% capacity in places of worship. The government of Francina Armengol of the PSOE also wants health checks at seaports and airports. For now, there are no restrictions on entering and leaving the islands. This region moved early against the coronavirus due to its extremely high incidence rate of 1,062 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. The entire region was sealed off last week save for the border with France (which falls under the purview of national authorities), and the government of María Chivite of the PSOE is considering whether to introduce further restrictions. For now, the 11pm-6am curfew has not been modified. The regional government of Iñigo Urkullu of the Basque Nationalist Party (PNV) is working on introducing strict restrictions on social gatherings in municipalities with high transmission rates after a regional court quashed an earlier attempt to do so. Urkullu was one of the most vocal supporters of a nationwide state of alarm to support stricter coronavirus measures. On Monday, the 14-day cumulative incidence reached in excess of 500 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. The five provinces that make up Castilla-La Mancha are under a variety of restrictions, although these are mostly to be found in Toledo and Guadalajara, which are closest to Madrid. Regional premier Emiliano García-Page of the PSOE has been confining municipalities since the summer in a bid to contain the pandemic. Since August 23, social gatherings had already been limited to a maximum of 10 people. Premier Alfonso Fernández Mañueco of the PP on Tuesday admitted that he is weighing the option of closing the region’s borders, but noted that decisions “must be based on a scientific foundation, and be consistent and balanced.” Perimetral confinements have been introduced since the summer and grown in number between September and October, affecting around 25% of the population. The curfew in Castilla y León starts at 10pm. On the other hand, perimetral lockdowns have been lifted in the cities of León, Palencia, Salamanca and Burgos. In Santiago de Compostela and the bordering town of O Milladoiro, socializing with people outside one’s household has been prohibited. Meanwhile, Ourense and Barbadàs have been under a perimetral confinement since October 7. Last week, authorities closed the city limits of Verín, Oímbra and Vilardevós. The regional government of Alberto Núñez Feijoó of the PP has yet to announce whether it will change the official curfew times. Faced with soaring transmission, regional premier Concha Andreu of the PSOE closed the borders of the entire region last week, a move that required authorization from a court as the state of alarm had not yet been introduced in Spain. The curfew times are 11pm to 6am. The small northern region had not adopted any significant measures due to good coronavirus figures, but a sudden spike in Santoña led to a perimetral lockdown in that municipality, followed by similar measures in Torrelavega and parts of the city of Santander. The government of Miguel Ángel Revilla, of the Regional Party of Cantabria (PRC), had openy supported a national state of alarm. The nighttime curfew in Cantabria begins at midnight. Faced with rising infection numbers over the summer months, the government of Fernando López Miras of the PP had already confined towns such as Totana and Lorca, and introduced social restrictions. The curfew will be applied between 11pm and 6am. Last week, at least 19 municipalities had limits on business capacity. The curfew here begins at midnight and ends at 6am.
